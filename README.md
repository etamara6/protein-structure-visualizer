# protein-structure-visualizer
 Interactive protein structure dashboard built with Streamlit — fetch any PDB entry, explore 3D Cα traces, compute biophysical properties (MW, charge, GRAVY, instability index), detect binding pockets, and calculate inter-atom distances. Powered by the RCSB Protein Data Bank.
